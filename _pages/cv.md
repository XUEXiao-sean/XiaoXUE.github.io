# Project Experience
* **Configuring People as Critics in Designer-led Smart Technology Design: A Case Study**, 2024
  * Conducted a user-centered design workshop aiming at creating intelligent experiences for pour-over coffee enthusiasts, positioning them as evaluators, critically examining how designers and engineers utilized design materials, analyzed data, and engaged in technical decision-making, revealing challenges within designer-led paradigms in Human-centered AI.
  * Contributed as the lead author by designing the research methodology, leading literature reviews, performing qualitative data analysis, and authoring the manuscript to consolidate findings and insights.
* **Research on Safeguarding Older Adults from Deepfake Scam**, 2024
  * Addressed the rising vulnerability of older adults to Deepfake-enabled scams by exploring safeguarding strategies through participatory design workshops.
  * Developed novel co-design methods for enabling older adults to critically evaluate scam scenarios and provide insights into safeguarding interventions.
* **Case Study: Towards an Experience-Centered Approach for Envisioning Non-driving Related Tasks in Fully Automated Vehicles**, 2024
  * A journal paper aimed to explore in-car activities in fully automated vehicles (FAV) with an experience-centered approach.
  * Designed participatory workshops coupled with AV cabin and Mixed Reality (MR) scenarios as means to facilitate speculative enactment and critiques on non-driving related tasks (NDRT).
  * Led thematic analysis of interview transcripts to explore how the cabin and MR scenarios become a resource for demand elicitation and capture critical contextual factors under experience.
* **What Can 3D Food Printing Technology Do for Older Adults? An Interdisciplinary Co-design Workshop**, 2024
  * A co-design workshop investigating opportunities and challenges in developing 3D food printing technology for older adults’ well-being.
  * Included 12 interdisciplinary participants with older people who have swallowing issues, elderly food practitioners, food printing researchers, cooking enthusiasts, and designers in brainstorming, knowledge sharing, and collaborative ideation of possible solutions.
  * Framed the workshop process, designed shared materials and resources, conducted post-workshop interviews with participants, and worked on qualitative data analysis.
* **Rethinking Empowerment in Home Automation among Cohabitants through the Lens of Co-Design**, 2023
  * Conducted a qualitative study with a series of co-design workshops, utilizing card-based tools to engage cohabitants with diverse backgrounds in the ideation of home automation.
  * Provided a critical perspective that identifies home automation as a problematic co-design process, showing how shared material and configuring processes in automation systems usage become obstacles and sources of empowerment through the lens of co-design.
* **Ballads Illusion: Enhancing the Attractiveness of British Ballads with Human-AI Collaboration**, 2021
  * Aimed to enhance the accessibility and attractiveness of British ballads provided by the National Library of Scotland to people outside the cultural context with human-AI collaboration.
  * Led the ideation and design by literature review and case study to define the design context, enabling technology, and methodologies.
  * Worked with over 22,000 paintings from the British in the 19th century as training data to train StyleGAN for generating new animated artwork.
